.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
wakes up
.Ar destination Ns No s
by despatching Wake-on-LAN magic packets on Layer 2.
Naturally, the
.Ar destination Ns No s
needs to support Wake-on-LAN technology.
Packets will be despatched from
.Ar interface
or the first available network interface found.
If the
.Fl b
is specified,
packets will be broadcast.
